# Iceberg-Detection
        Icebergs present serious hazards for ship navigation and offshore installations.
Consequently, there is a large interest to localize them timely and over vast areas. 
To build an algorithm which automatically identifies whether a remotely sensed target is an iceberg or not. 
Often times an iceberg is wrongly classified as a ship. Ship detection is an important topic in the field of remote sensing.
At present, many object detection methods have been developed in the pattern recognition community. 
However, many of the proposed systems have computationally intensive problems for high accuracy performance.
The algorithm had to be extremely accurate because lives and billions of dollars in energy
infrastructure are at stake. As it is a tedious process to record live radar images we can
create a web applcation where user can upload available radar images. This uploaded
image is analysed by the model which is built and prediction is showcased on the UI.
